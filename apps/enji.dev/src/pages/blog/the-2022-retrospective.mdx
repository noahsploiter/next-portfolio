If you have a Computer Science background, probably, you have heard about the Fibonacci Number, also known as the Fibonacci Sequence.

At its core, the Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers that starts with 0 and 1, and each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The formula looks like this:

**Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2**

Even though the Fibonacci algorithm is very famous, many people struggle when trying to find an optimal solution, but that's not you! By the end of this blog post, you will know three methods (recursive, memoization, dynamic) to implement the Fibonacci algorithm.



Recovery selama 9 bulan lamanya, dimana saat itu saya sulit untuk berjalan dan juga sulit untuk mengetik.

Benar-benar istirahat di rumah, nyalain komputer pun jarang, ngetik pun cuma bisa pake tangan kanan :(

Akhir 2021, kaki dan tangan saya berangsur pulih. Awal 2022 merasa kaki dan tangan saya sudah benar-benar pulih total dan bisa beraktivitas seperti biasanya. Alhamdulillah :)

## Recursive Solution

A recursive algorithm calls itself with smaller input variables and returns the result for the current input by carrying out basic operations on the returned value for the smaller input. By using recursive algorithms, certain problems can be solved quite easily.
