One of the most important things for me when working from home is having the right tools. So, let's start with my main device - the computer.

## Computer

| Name       | Detail                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| OS         | Windows 11 Home 64-bit           |
| Proccessor | Intel Core i7 8565U CPU @1.80GHz |
| RAM        | 16GB 3600Mhz DDR4                |
| GPU        | No                               |
| Storage    | 1 TB                             |

This computer may not have the latest specs, but it runs incredibly fast and smooth! It's perfect for web development, even for larger or heavier projects.

The 16GB of RAM also ensures that multitasking is a breeze!
